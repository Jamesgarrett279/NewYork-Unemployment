# NewYork-Unemployment
This was my contribution to a group project (my final project for my last python class)


This program's main function is to show how the COVID epidemic has affected the unemployment rate in New York by comparing 2020's unemployment rate to previous years. Fair warning: the data in the .csv files are a little old and don't have November or December's rates due to them not being available when this project was created.
